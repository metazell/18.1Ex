<ul>- What is HTTP?</ul>
    <li>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests and information on the internet. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a protocol used for fetching resources such as HTML documents. HTTP follows a client-server model where the client (such as a web browser) makes a request to the server, which then responds.</li>

 <ul>What is a URL?</ul>
    <li> URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the internet. A URL specifies the location of a resource as well as the protocol used to access it. For example, in the URL </li>

<ul>- What is DNS?</ul>
    <li>DNS (Domain Name System) is the system used to translate human-friendly domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. DNS is like the phonebook of the internet, converting easy-to-remember names into the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices.</li>

<ul>- What is a query string?</ul>
    <li>A query string is a part of a URL that assigns values to specified parameters. It is typically used to pass data to web applications. A query string begins with a question mark (?) followed by key-value pairs separated by '&'.</li>

<ul>- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</ul>
    <li>GET: Used to request data from a specified resource. GET requests are typically used to retrieve data and have no effect on the data.
    POST: Used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. POST requests can change the state of the server and typically involve sending data in the body of the request.</li>

<ul>- What is an HTTP request?</ul>
    <li>HTTP request is a message sent by the client to the server to request data or perform an action.</li>

<ul>- What is an HTTP response?</ul>
    <li>HTTP response is a message sent by the server to the client in reply to an HTTP request.</li>

<ul>- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen. </ul>
    <li>HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent in HTTP requests and responses to provide information about the request or response or about the object sent in the message body.</li>

<ul>- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?</ul>
    <li>Resolution: The browser contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name (somesite.com) into an IP address.</li>
    <li>TCP Connection: The browser establishes a TCP connection with the server at the resolved IP address.</li>
    <li>HTTP Request: The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, requesting the specific resource (/some/page.html).</li>
    <li>Server Processing: The server processes the request, finds the requested resource, and prepares an HTTP response.</li>
    <li>HTTP Response: The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser, including the requested resource (e.g., an HTML page).</li>
    <li>Rendering: The browser renders the HTML content, potentially making additional requests for resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files as specified in the HTML.</li>
